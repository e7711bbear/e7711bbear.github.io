    <h3>Cui Bono</h3>
<p>As I said in the previous chapter, the inspiration for this one came from a rant from the movie Revolver.</p>
<p>I used to refer to this principle as "What's in it for me" because of this inspiration but Cui Bono is a much better way.</p>
<p>The point is simple, in any situation, invest yourself into understanding the complete map of all actors' "what's in it for me". 
Or in other words, cui bono - to whom is it a benefit.</p>
<p>You have to accept with a kind mind that most situations are crafted in a way to control the balance to some advantage. 
If you want to reject this principle, it's fine, move on to the next chapter. I know life has its way to teach this lesson on its own.</p>
<p>Once you have accepted that, you can start to look at it with an open mind.</p>
<p>Whether it is a salary negotiation, a promotion, a technical decision, a team restructure or the provider of the paper in the printer -&gt; cui bono.</p>
<p>The open mind is very important. You're not approaching this like a witch hunt (or a paranoid conspiracist mind). 
People just doing things because it came to them is a valid and common answer. 
As in, it benefits them because that's an easy choice. Don't default to find conspiracies at every corner.</p>
<p>I was promoted in the past because it benefited my manager. I promoted people because it benefited me. In both cases, there was a lot more benefits to a lot more individuals direct and indirect.
Understanding this empowers you to make better decisions. Just like Ray Liotta said in Revolver: "The more the man invest in that question, the more powerful the man becomes".</p>
