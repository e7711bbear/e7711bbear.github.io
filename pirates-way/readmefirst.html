    <h2>Read Me First</h2>
<p>Let's address the title. </p>
<p>The attitude I like to promote is the one of people who are fearlessly navigating the metaphorical sea of high-tech believing in their ability to handle new challenges on a regular basis.
To do so, they develop the skills and the mindset to set their own rules, challenge the status quo and in the process accomplish things that were out of their reach before.
I call people who work this way, pirates. It's a mark of respect anchored in the old definition of hackers that started this entire industry ~50 years ago.</p>
<p>Now, what you're getting into. </p>
<p>I've developed my methodology over the past ~20 years (and counting) working on very diverse environment building tech products. 
I've made countless mistakes, picked countless ridiculous battles and died on the dumbest hills you can imagine.
But along the way, I've also learned from my mistakes, met incredible people, learned from them and came up with a set of skills that allows me to tackle any tech product problem with confidence.</p>
<p>I've never put anything that would collect all these lessons together, as it was a very personal "playbook" I would only use when coaching or mentoring my staff, friends or clients.
This is because for me, most of this methodology is mostly build off pieces widely covered and available online for free.
At times, I thought it'd be good for me to have a reference somewhere, but still, I never pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the demand for me to put something together has only increased in frequency.
I used to respond that it's all online. Gave a few names and left it to that, but I got convinced that like my composition is like a recipe: having access to the ingredients doesn't take away the value of the steps to bake the cake.</p>
<p>So here we are, this is the most detailed material I have written on my methodology to build tech products and the teams behind them.</p>
