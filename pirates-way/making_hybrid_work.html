    <h2>Making Hybrid Work</h2>
<p>If you're not familiar with Hybrid work, it's a part-time in the office and part-time remote work model on - mostly - the employees terms (they choose which days, rarely how many days). 
This can easily become the worst of all models because employees end up forced to stay in expensive living areas, commute in miserable conditions, fight to find a meeting room - most likely one of these design-sweat-box-phone-booth-thingy - or worse use an open space area that promotes holding your opinion to yourself - to mostly take online calls you could have had better from home.</p>
<p>It's a land of compromise that's becoming more and more popular as so few companies actually look into what works and what doesn't and try to rush out the fix.
Many places are using it as a trojan horse to bring people back to the office and every couple of month, we get an article about the state of the 'negotiation'.</p>
<p>Making this model work is actually quite simple: 
1/ Don't give the choice to the employees on which days they can take
2/ stick to <strong>2 days (or less)</strong> per week in office and
3/ make these days being <strong>Tuesday</strong> and <strong>Thursdays</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday is usually packed with meetings to set the week in motion (alignment meetings) - Take these home.</li>
<li>Tuesday is where the first cross-collaboration happens and these are the meeting moments that are the most challenging to run remote.</li>
<li>Wednesdays you're acting on Tuesday's thinking.</li>
<li>Thursday is cross func review of Wednesdays.</li>
<li>Friday is post-mortem, wind down and most people are half switched on anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is obviously a hyper simplification, but the key takeaways are:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 or fewer days a week,</li>
<li>Create 'Meeting Days',</li>
<li>Stagger them so action can follow,</li>
<li>Reserve office time for cross collaboration.</li>
</ul>
