    <h3>VP</h3>
<p>At the VP level, your responsibility evolves to a new height with a blanket responsibility for comprehensive need to handle problems and opportunities.</p>
<p>This is why we first need to dive into the three components of senior management: Strategy, Tactic and Execution.</p>
<h4>Strategy, Tactic and Execution</h4>
<p>Strategy is the work of defining a north star and the rough milestones to get to it. 
This is rarely if ever a straight line. Usually a complicated journey composed of parallel tracks with moderate to high risk of failure that joins back to create a compounded value unlocking the next step or leapfrog a few.</p>
<p>Tactic is the work of the balance of the impact of the next few steps. 
What can be done in the direction of the strategy that can have the biggest impact for lowest cost. 
You're making decision for immediate action that positively impacts the outcome.</p>
<p>Execution is the work of producing, supporting and monitoring the infrastructure, team, processes and workflows that delivers the tactical and strategic direction.
At the VP level, this is a lot of planning when most of it is delegated to other people. Usually, if you aren't delegating it's a sign of a problem, but it can be just a sign of the company you are in (size, culture, stage, etc).</p>
<p>At the VP level, you are expected to own a department and master the tactical and execution aspect of a given strategy. 
Your input on the strategy is necessary and expected, but your time has to be spent on the other two.</p>
<h4>VP of Product</h4>
<p>A VP of Product owns the product department. This department is at the junction of multiple role between 'business' and 'engineering'. 
Tying it back to the <a href="trifecta.html">Trifecta</a>, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Trifecta Extended" src="./images/trifecta-extended-product.jpeg" /> </p>
<p>Functionally speaking, the Product function incorporates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Product Management</li>
<li>QA</li>
<li>Program Management</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Product Management</strong> defines the work to be done.
Product Managers of different level are the one doing most of this work.</p>
<p><strong>QA</strong> validates the work was done to the definitions.
QA testers &amp; managers write the test cases with Product Managers, organize the test runs, maintain consistency in the execution, report on the results.</p>
<p><strong>Program Management</strong> coordinates product-wide, cross-team - usually with external parties.
Program Managers with different prefixes are the coordinating force, keeping people informed, driving the conversation to resolution, keeping all in check. They are the metronome of the dynamic in place.
Note that Program Managers aren't exclusive of Product. You will find Program Managers in Engineering and other Business roles.</p>
<p>All these functions represent the infrastructure that guides what the product should be, but also maintains the flow of information circulating around, as once the what is figured out, you need to sustain it for it to become real and communicate it so it can reach the end user.</p>
<p>To that effect, the product function run by the VP of Product must drive and maintain the relationship between roles.
These relationships require some structure, expected materials and often a routine schedule.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown I tend to follow. It's not to be used verbatim, the unique situation you are in will require a different balance of importance for each of these. A healthy room for interpretation is necessary and a good VP will know how to adjust. </p>
<h5>Product &harr; Engineering</h5>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Get the engineering team on the same page, clarify any dark area and answer all open questions. Some of which will come as the product is being built.</p>
<p><strong>Key Materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product Description</li>
<li>Temple Feature Descriptions</li>

<li>Any off cycle feature review (feasibility, complexity understanding, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Product &harr; Project</h5>

</ul>
<h5>Product &harr; Sales</h5>

<li>User Manuals</li>
<li>Troubleshooting Guide</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Internal Training</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Meet Schedules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 to 2 times a month</li>
<li>Upon issues being raised</li>
</ul>
<h5>Company Wide Communication</h5>
<p>The product function as owned and run by the VP of Product has a responsibility to communicate constantly to the wider company. The larger the engagement, the better as this is a common pitfall.</p>
<p>Focusing on the execution part of the Product is usually where too many Product team get lost into, this is why the VP of Product must be keeping track on communication - if not directly communicate to the wider company to get everybody a regular sense of where things are.</p>
<p>The frequency of this depends on the iteration velocity of the company. For instance, if you deploy every week, this communication will be multiple times a week.</p>
<p>The key pieces of information that must be communicated are:</p>
<p>1/ Scope decision for upcoming releases</p>
<ul>
<li>Always address why</li>
<li>Always anchor it to the north star</li>
<li>Always anchor it to the theme of the release</li>
</ul>
<p>2/ QA/Pre-release progress update</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily or multiple times a week</li>
<li>Creates dynamism and engagement close to the finishing line</li>
<li>Refreshes everyone on what's to come</li>
<li>Triggers gap-filling meetings requests from all parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>3/ Launch celebration</p>
<ul>
<li>Wraps up efforts</li>
<li>Rewards the wider team for collective effort</li>
<li>Rewards key player for exceptional contribution (role model building)</li>
</ul>
<p>4/ Market results post launch</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the team engaged on the product past launch</li>
<li>Engages the team on thinking on next steps</li>
</ul>
<p>The how matter a lot less than the what and when, but the VP of Product <strong>has to</strong> organize all this work from a department standpoint, fill voids that no one else can in the org and be the face of the collective effort when necessary. </p>
