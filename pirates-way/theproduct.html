    <h2>The Product</h2>
<p>We've gone through the 'theory', it's time to dive into the practice.</p>
<p>For this next chapter, I'm going to use fictitious companies as case studies. Different industries, different markets, different sizes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Robotics Inc</strong> is a VC-backed, Series-C startup developing rovers for industrial and public safety users. 
Their main product is remote controlled with advanced navigation and situation awareness capabilities. 
They offer multiple payloads that allow to adjust for any circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trading LLC</strong> is a hedge fund style trading company that built a heavy tech stack to do most of their trading on stocks automatically. 
They don't sell their tech to anyone as it's their edge against the competition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crypto Inc</strong> is a seed-stage startup that's building a social network on web3. Their main product allows people to find each other and exchange goods using fiat and crypto currencies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout the next pages, I'm going to use these examples to illustrate how I would go out at the challenges they face using my methodology and mindset.</p>
<h4>The Nature of Disruption</h4>
<p>Disruption is in practice simpler than the myth the term tends to carry. To disrupt, your product needs to do either or both of these things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Achieving similar or better results as before but at a radically lower cost (time and money) and larger scale - Think about the printing press.</li>
<li>Achieving drastically better results (more &amp; faster) as before by leveraging a brand-new way of doing the work that has never been done before - Think about inspecting assets with a drone.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you achieve both, that is lower cost, larger scale and faster, your disruption is a revolution - think smartphones and digital photography.</p>
<p>Digital photography is particularly interesting because the cost of a photo has basically gone to 0 as any digital camera can produce an infinite number of pictures. Which is a complete revolution from the film era.</p>
<p>Disruptable markets are simply markets that have been in an extended period of time of high cost and/or low productivity while a solution seems within reach with established technology. 
Your ability to disrupt here lies in your internal capacity to bring science and product.</p>
