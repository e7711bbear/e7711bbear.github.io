    <h3>Manager</h3>
<p>When I refer to manager, I refer to the role which includes people management. I consider Product, Project, Delivery and Program Managers as ICs. The title isn't always reflective of the role you carry.
In a similar way, many people in the tech industry wear fancy titles but are just managers. This is a very simply distinction. If you manage a group of people who are mostly ICs, you are a manager.</p>
<p>As the first role after an ICs, the manager is one of the most important and difficult role to have. This is because you're morphing out of the IC role unto something that's different, while at the same time being called to the IC side on a regular basis with the need to hold back from getting sucked into it again.</p>
<p>If you promote too soon or as a reward for good behaviour (way worse) you are going to not only impair your team's ability to perform, you're also sabotaging this person's career as they will now have the sticky expectation to evolve at a level they aren't equiped to handle. 
Not only this, but this level they hold on to will no longer provide the platform to learn how to perform. Once you wear the title, you wear the responsibility. This is the implicit contract that goes with every promotion and it never fails to bite back.</p>
<p>here, define too soon. Cover people who are entering the zone of skills but not validated yet as a valid early approach.</p>
